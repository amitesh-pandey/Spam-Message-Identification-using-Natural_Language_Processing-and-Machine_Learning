# Spam-Message-check-using-Natural_Language_Processing & Machine-Learning-

This Repository describes about the identification of spam or ham messages using Natural Language Processing & Machine Learning Algorithm. Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics,which is used for the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Further classification based Machine Learning algorithm was applied in order to predict whether the following messages are spam or else is a ham messages.
Here I have introduced the concepts of Pipeline which is used to help automate machine learning workflows. 

The Steps followed are : 
1. Loading a tsv files using pandas 
2. Checking for any missing or null values, further making the imbalance data as balance to avoid biasing 
3. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Separating the dataset to training & testing dataset 
5. Performing Bag-of-words using TF-IDF 
6. Creating the Pipeline for vectorization & Machine Learning Algorithm 
7. Comparative results are predicted between random forest & SVM 

Based on the comparative analysis, it was found that Support Vector Machine shows the higest accuracy rate of 94.64% when compared to Random Forest.
